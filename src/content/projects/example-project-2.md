## Project Overview

SmartStudy AI Tutor is an intelligent tutoring system designed to provide personalized educational support for college students. The system uses AI to adapt to each student's learning style, pace, and preferences, creating a customized learning experience.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Learning Paths**: The AI analyzes a student's strengths and weaknesses to create tailored study plans.
- **Interactive Lessons**: Engaging content with quizzes, flashcards, and interactive exercises.
- **Natural Language Questions**: Students can ask questions in natural language and receive detailed explanations.
- **Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive analytics on learning progress and areas for improvement.
- **Multi-modal Learning**: Content delivered through text, audio, and visual formats to accommodate different learning styles.

## Technical Implementation

Our system is built on a Python backend with a React frontend. We use a fine-tuned GPT model for generating explanations and answering questions, complemented by a recommendation system that suggests appropriate learning materials based on the student's progress.

For speech output, we implemented text-to-speech capabilities using the Web Speech API, allowing students to listen to explanations while reading along or doing other tasks.

## Challenges and Learning

The biggest challenge we faced was creating a truly adaptive system that could accurately assess a student's knowledge level. We addressed this by implementing a Bayesian knowledge tracing algorithm that continuously updates its understanding of the student's mastery of different concepts.

Another significant challenge was generating explanations that were both accurate and easy to understand. We found that fine-tuning our language model on a dataset of high-quality educational content significantly improved the quality of explanations.

## Future Improvements

In future iterations, we plan to:

- Integrate with university course management systems
- Add support for collaborative learning with peer-to-peer features
- Develop more sophisticated knowledge assessment techniques
- Expand content coverage to more academic subjects
- Implement spaced repetition algorithms for better retention
