# Practical Generative AI

## Course Description

This course serves as an introduction to generative AI and its practical applications in software development. Through a hands-on approach, students will gain foundational knowledge of generative AI while learning to use various AI development tools, platforms, and frameworks. The course focuses on building and deploying AI-powered applications, culminating in a substantial team project that provides real-world experience in creating AI-driven software. By course completion, students will be equipped to integrate AI into their applications and development processes, opening new possibilities for creativity and innovation.

## Course Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Design and implement Generative AI applications across various industries using low-code platforms for rapid prototyping and testing.
- Create conversational agents and question-answering systems using language models, enhanced through advanced techniques such as memory, retrieval, chaining, and agency.
- Develop personalized assistants and specialized chatbots that interact with private data and documents, utilizing embeddings, vector databases, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance retrieval without model training or fine-tuning.
- Build and deploy LLM-powered services as callable APIs, including management, debugging, and monitoring of language model behavior in complex interactions using DevOps tools and best practices.
- Utilize language models as developer tools to accelerate application development through code improvement, debugging, understanding, and documentation.

## Instructional Approach: Project-Based Learning

The course is divided into two phases: an 7-8 week instructional period followed by a 6-7 week project period.

The instructional phase consists of lectures on various topics and techniques, emphasizing hands-on learning through sample application development. This approach helps students understand concepts within practical contexts. Students will complete several homework assignments during this phase to reinforce their understanding.

During the project phase, students work in teams of 5-6 members to create a full-stack software application integrating generative AI. Teams propose their own project ideas and select their preferred tech stack. Lecture periods transition into project meetings, where teams receive guidance and support.

This approach provides essential theoretical knowledge while maximizing practical skills development for incorporating generative AI in software development.
